# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the application of machine learning algorithms for early-stage breast cancer detection. Using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, the goal is to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on extracted features from fine-needle aspirate (FNA) images.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement machine learning models to improve breast cancer detection.
- Compare various algorithms and evaluate their accuracy.
- Develop a reliable system that aids in early diagnosis.

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Standardized the dataset.
   - Handled missing values.
   - Performed feature scaling.
2. **Machine Learning Models Used:**
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
3. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
   - Best accuracy achieved: **98.24% using SVM**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.
- **Size:** 569 instances, 30 features.
- **Target Variable:** Malignant (1) / Benign (0).
